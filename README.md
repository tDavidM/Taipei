Taipei is an accurate 32 bits clone of the original 1990 Taipei game (16 bits) written by Dave Norris that was included in the first Microsoft Entertainment Pack.
This clone was made without any access to the original source code and is written in C++ using Borland C++ Builder 2006.
Remakes of Taipei were reintroduced with Windows 7 and 10 respectively as Mahjong Titans and Microsoft Mahjong.
